Question X

A sixth-form college wants a program to process students’ test results.

The program will:

Ask for the number of students in the class

For each student, input their name and three test scores

Calculate averages and grades

Output summary statistics

(a) State two validation checks that should be applied when inputting test scores.

[2]

(b) Write a Python function called calculate_average that:

Takes a list of integers as a parameter

Returns the average value

[3]

(c) Write a Python function called assign_grade that:

Takes the average score as a parameter

Returns a grade according to the table below

Average score	Grade
70 or above	A
60–69	B
50–59	C
40–49	D
Below 40	F

[4]

(d) Write a Python program that:

Asks the user for the number of students

Uses a loop to input:

Student name

Three test scores

Stores the data in a suitable data structure

Uses the functions from parts (b) and (c)

Outputs each student’s:

Name

Average score (rounded to 1 decimal place)

Grade

[9]

(e) The program must also output:

The class average

The highest student average

The lowest student average

Explain how your program achieves this.
