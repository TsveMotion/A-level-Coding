# A-Level Coding

This repository contains my **A-Level Computer Science (OCR) programming work**, written in **Python**.  
All programs are **console-based** and focus on core programming skills required for **Year 12 and Year 13**.

The work is designed to match **OCR exam-style questions**, with an emphasis on clear logic, structured code, and correct use of programming techniques.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Core Programming Skills
- Variables and data types
- Selection (`if / elif / else`)
- Iteration (`for` and `while` loops)
- Functions and procedures
- Lists and dictionaries
- Searching techniques
- Basic sorting logic
- Input validation
- Arithmetic processing
- Formatted output (f-strings)

---

## 🧪 Example Programs
- Student results and grade calculation systems  
- Data storage using lists and dictionaries  
- Searching for records by key (e.g. name)  
- Summary and statistics output  
- Exam-style programming tasks  

All programs run in the **terminal / command line** and do not require any external libraries.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository is used to:
- Practise Python programming for **OCR A-Level Computer Science**
- Prepare for programming questions in exams
- Reinforce problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Build confidence with structured, readable code
- Serve as a revision and reference resource

---

## 🧠 Exam Board
- **OCR A-Level Computer Science**

The coding style and techniques follow patterns commonly expected in OCR mark schemes.

---

## 🚀 Possible Extensions
- More advanced searching and sorting algorithms
- File handling (reading and writing data)
- Improved validation and error handling
- Larger exam-style programming challenges
- Introductory object-oriented programming (Year 13)
